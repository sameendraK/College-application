This app is built using express JS and the main functionalities include:
1. User Registration: A user can register so that bookings for the slots can be done.
2. User Login: After registeration, when the user logs in, he can check available slots, booked slots etc. Once user logs in, a bearer token is given and without it, no transaction can nbe done.
3. Multiple user types: There are two user types currently. One is Dean and other is Student.
4. Slot Registration: Dean can have their own acount and based on their preference, the slots will be displayed to the user. Dean can choose which slot to show.
5. Check Slot status: Once dean has the slots registered, he can check if the slot has been booked by any of the students. If the slot is booked, then we display the details of the student who has done it and also we show the slot start time and slot duration.
6. Slot Booking: Students can book the slots and once booking is done, the slot status will be automatically updated based on the time.
7. Update slot based on slot time: Slot can be updated by dean in case of any unforeseen circumstances.
